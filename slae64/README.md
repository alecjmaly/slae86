## Assignment 1 [ ]
Create a Shell_Bind_TCP shellcode
- Binds to a port  
- Needs a "Passcode"  
- If Passcode is correct then Execs Shell 

- Remove 0x00 from the Bind TCP Shellcode
discussed 

## Assignment 2  [ ]
Create a Shell_Reverse_TCP shellcode
- Reverse connects to configured IP and Port 
- Needs a "Passcode"  
- If Passcode is correct then Execs Shell 

- Remove 0x00 from the Reverse TCP Shellcode
discussed

## Assignment 3 [ ]
Study about the Egg Hunter shellcode
- Create a working demo of the Egghunter
- Should be configurable for different payloads

## Assignment 4 [ ]
Create a custom encoding scheme like the 
"InserSon Encoder" we showed you 
- PoC with using execve-stack as the shellcode
to encode with your schema and execute 

## Assignement 5 [ ]
Create a custom encoding scheme like the 
"InserSon Encoder" we showed you 
- PoC with using execve-stack as the shellcode
to encode with your schema and execute 

## Assignment 6 [ ]
Take up 3 shellcodes from Shell-Storm and 
create polymorphic versions of them to beat 
paNern matching 
- The polymorphic versions cannot be larger 
150% of the exisSng shellcode
- Bonus points for making it shorter in length 
than origina

## Assignment 7 [ ]
Create a custom crypter like the one shown in 
the "crypters" video 
- Free to use any exisSng encrypSon schema 
- Can use any programming language
